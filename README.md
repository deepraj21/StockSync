# Prediction Model Explaination

This function, `predict_next_day_price(ticker)`, uses historical stock price data to predict the closing price of a stock for the next day. Here is a detailed breakdown of the function:

1. **Data Retrieval**:
   ```python
   data = yf.download(ticker, period='1mo', interval='1d')
   ```
   - The function uses the `yfinance` library to download historical stock price data for the given ticker symbol.
   - The data retrieved is for the past month (`period='1mo'`) with daily intervals (`interval='1d'`).

2. **Date Processing**:
   ```python
   data['Date'] = data.index
   data['Date'] = data['Date'].map(lambda x: x.toordinal())
   ```
   - The index of the DataFrame, which contains the dates, is assigned to a new column named `Date`.
   - The dates are then converted to ordinal format (number of days since a fixed date), which is necessary for numerical computations.

3. **Feature and Target Variable Preparation**:
   ```python
   X = np.array(data['Date']).reshape(-1, 1)
   y = data['Close'].values
   ```
   - The `Date` column, now in ordinal format, is converted to a NumPy array and reshaped to a 2D array, `X`.
   - The closing prices are extracted into a NumPy array, `y`.

4. **Model Training**:
   ```python
   model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
   ```
   - A linear regression model from the `sklearn` library is instantiated and trained using the date ordinals (`X`) as the feature and the closing prices (`y`) as the target variable.

5. **Next Day Prediction**:
   ```python
   next_day = np.array([[X[-1, 0] + 1]])
   prediction = model.predict(next_day)
   ```
   - The next day's date ordinal is computed by adding 1 to the last date ordinal in `X`.
   - The model predicts the closing price for this next day.

6. **Return Prediction**:
   ```python
   return prediction[0]
   ```
   - The predicted closing price for the next day is returned as the output.

In summary, this function leverages historical stock price data to fit a linear regression model, which is then used to predict the next day's closing price based on the trend observed in the past month.
